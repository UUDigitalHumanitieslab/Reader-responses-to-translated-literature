# Reader-responses-to-translated-literature

This repo contains the work we do in the Research-IT project with Haidee Kotze and Gys-Walt van Egdom.

It contains a GoodReads scraper, in the 'scrapers' folder. This is an old version: the current version is part of the 'scapers' repository.

Other modules are to analyse the Goodreads reviews. 'embeddings' is for training and evaluating word embeddings using word2vec. 'preprocessing' is for tokenisation. 'collocations' is for finding collocates. 

## Setup

The analysis is written in python 3.6. Instructions for setting up an environment to follow.
